## Summary
This application is a to-do list that allows a user to personalize the appearance by changing the name and title, and allows the user to input tasks, mark the tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list.  This was a fun and exciting project that was a conceptual milestone for me because it shows the overwhelming potential with implimenting user input to make an application interactive.  This project uses the DOM to create and remove HTML elements based on the event listener.!
